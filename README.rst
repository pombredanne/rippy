A simple library for just hanging helper functions for reStructuredText generation.

I find myself doing a lot of auto reStructuredText document generation, so I'm
throwing this out for others to use as well.  It's definately alpha - but hope
to make it generally useful for anyone auto generating reST documentation.

For all I know, this exists elsewhere and I couldn't find it.  I will note I
was too lazy to splunk through docutils more then 5 or 10 minutes.

So whatever
