A simple reST library for generating reStructure Text markup.

I find myself doing a lot of automatted reStructuredText document generation, and need
to simplify differnet scripts and packages, so I threw this together.  It started as part
of my OraclePyDoc package.  It's definately alpha - but hope to make it generally useful 
for anyone programattically generating reST markup.

Disclaimer:  For all I know, this exists elsewhere out there.... and I couldn't find it.  
I will note I was too lazy to splunk through docutils more then 5 or 10 minutes....So whatever
